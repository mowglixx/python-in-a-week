# :rocket: Python in a Week

Python in a week is a simple coding course designed to be studied and completed within one week. 

This project is intended to work within a Dev Container

## ðŸš¨ Requirements

- This is a simple course but a week is *advised*, depending on aptitude and experience you may get through it in a few hours.
- **No coding knowledge is required** although familiarity with installing and running programs is required.
- Hard work is required as with all skills.

### Hardware

- 64-bit OS (one of):
  - Windows 10+
  - Linux (Kernel 5+)
  - Mac OS
- A Docker capable processor
- 8 GB of RAM
- 8+ GB Disk Space
- Active Internet Connection

### Software

Depending on your operating system you will need to perform different steps to install these.

To install extensions in VS Code see ([How to install Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace))

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Extensions
    - [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started)
    - [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) `needed for the Dev Containers extention to work`

## Getting Started

This course is divided into modules and is intended to be followed in order.

| Module                                                     |  Day  | 
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|
| [Data, Types and Manipulation](#module-1-data-types-and-manipulation)          |  1   | 
| [Logic, Scope and Loops](#module-2-logic-scope-and-loops)                |  2   | 
| [Functions](#module-3-functions)                  |  3   | 
| [Classes](#module-4-classes) |  4   | 
| [Project Planning](#module-5-project-planning)                      |  5   | 
| [Weekend Project](#module-6-weekend-project)                       |  6-7 | 


### Module 1. Data, Types and Manipulation

On Day 1 to avoid confusion we will be learning some `concepts` to build upon as the course progresses, this will get you familliar with a certain `workflow` that will get you comfortable within a code editor window and using the terminal.

You will learn the basics of programming, these principles, starting with `Data`, `Data Types` and `Data Manipulation`, will open the door to other languages, for the sake of simplicity and readability we will be using Python 3.10 or greater. 

### Module 2. Logic, Scope and Loops

On Day 2 you will learn about the concept of `scope` and how it impacts your code, we will learn about `logic` and `flow control`, this powerful concept is a lot simpler than it sounds and is used in every module afterwards, it boils down to:

```
if 'this' then 'that'
```

If you understand the above then you should be fine, when adding loops to this module you just do it all again!

### Module 3. Functions

In this module you will learn about re-using code and building larger building blocks to work with, imagine you were building a huge LegoÂ® Castle but all the pieces are tiny, it would take you an age just to finish a single wall! 

When we build our own `functions` we can make bigger pieces to build our projects with thus speeding up our productivity, neat.

### Module 4. Classes

In this module you will learn about `Object Oriented Programming`, or `OOP` for short, this module will cover the basics of *essentially** creating your own `data type` with it's own `methods` and `properties`

**You are not actually creating a data type but it can be used in a lot of the same ways as you'll see*

### Module 5. Project Planning

This Module will be quite light as there is a [weekend project](#module-6---7-weekend-project) to help you **acheive a goal**, that goal will be determined by **you**, there will be advice on tools to use online to help you plan you project so you can learn an important skill in programming... Time management, no joke. 

>If you're like me and *PC* may as well stand for *Personal Casino* (not gambling just time awareness) then it can be important to set limits, programming is resource heavy on your body without you noticing, remember to hydrate! 

`Planning` can prevent you from spending too much time on `Feature A` when you need `Feature B` finished an hour ago.

### Module 6. Weekend Project
